**what currently exists?**
A complete React frontend prototype for the PolluxKart e-commerce store has been built. All requested pages (Home, Store, Product, Cart, Checkout, Orders, Wishlist, Auth) are implemented with mock data. A design system with a teal and lime green color palette is in place. The API service layer for products and cart has been created and integrated into the , with a fallback to mock data. The latest set of user requests, including the wishlist, INR currency, and phone authentication, have been coded but are not yet tested.

**Last working item**:
*   **Last item agent was working:** The agent was in the middle of a large feature update based on the user's latest 6 requests. It had coded the logic for all features, including creating new files and overwriting existing ones. The very last action was creating new, improved SVG files for the logo and favicon. The agent was about to update the  component to use the new design but has not done so yet.
*   **Status:** IN PROGRESS
*   **Agent Testing Done:** N
*   **Which testing method agent to use?** Frontend testing agent. A large number of changes across multiple components and contexts (Auth, Cart, Wishlist, Products) were made without verification. A comprehensive test is required.
*   **User Testing Done:** N

**All Pending/In progress Issue list**:
*   **Issue 1:** Verify the fix for a corrupted file and test INR currency implementation. (P0)
*   **Issue 2:** The  component may not be using the latest improved SVG design. (P1)

*   **Issues Detail:**
    *   **Issue 1:**
        *   **Attempted fixes:** A  command corrupted . The agent overwrote the file to fix it.
        *   **Next debug checklist:**
            1.  Run yarn run v1.22.22
info Visit https://yarnpkg.com/en/docs/cli/run for documentation about this command. to ensure no syntax errors exist in  or other recently modified files.
            2.  Thoroughly test all pages where prices are displayed (Product Card, Product Page, Cart Page, Checkout Summary, Order Page) to confirm they use the  utility and show the ₹ symbol correctly.
        *   **Why fix this issue and what will be achieved with the fix?** To fulfill the user's requirement for INR currency and ensure the cart page functions correctly.
        *   **Status:** TESTING PENDING
        *   **Is recurring issue?** Y (File corruption via  is a known risk).
        *   **Should Test frontend/backend/both after fix?** Frontend.
        *   **Blocked on other issue:** None.
    *   **Issue 2:**
        *   **Attempted fixes:** New SVG files (, ) were created in the  directory.
        *   **Next debug checklist:**
            1.  View the content of .
            2.  Compare its SVG code with the new code in .
            3.  If they differ, update  with the new SVG code.
        *   **Why fix this issue and what will be achieved with the fix?** To complete the user's request for an improved, catchy logo design.
        *   **Status:** IN PROGRESS
        *   **Is recurring issue?** N
        *   **Should Test frontend/backend/both after fix?** Frontend.
        *   **Blocked on other issue:** None.

**In progress Task List**:
*   **Task 1:** Complete and test the batch of 6 new features. (P0)

*   **Task Detail:**
    *   **Task 1:**
        *   **Where to resume:**
            1.  First, resolve Issue 2 by ensuring  is updated with the new logo design.
            2.  Run yarn run v1.22.22
info Visit https://yarnpkg.com/en/docs/cli/run for documentation about this command. to check for compilation errors after all recent changes.
            3.  If the build succeeds, restart the frontend and use the frontend testing agent to systematically test all 6 recently implemented features: INR currency, wishlist, out-of-stock UI, phone auth, reorder button, and toaster close button.
        *   **What will be achieved with this?** This will complete the user's latest set of feature requests and ensure the application is stable.
        *   **Status:** IN PROGRESS
        *   **Should Test frontend/backend/both after fix?** Frontend.
        *   **Blocked on something:** None.

**Upcoming and Future Tasks**
*   None specified by the user. The current feature set appears to be complete from the user's perspective.

**Code Architecture**


**Key Technical Concepts**
-   **Frontend:** React, Tailwind CSS, shadcn/ui
-   **State Management:** React Context API
-   **Routing:** React Router DOM
-   **API:** A service layer using  is built to communicate with a backend, with a graceful fallback to mock data if the API is unreachable.

**key DB schema**
N/A (Frontend prototype only)

**changes in tech stack**
None.

**All files of reference**
-   **/app/frontend/src/pages/StorePage.jsx**: Contains the primary API integration logic with mock data fallback.
-   **/app/frontend/src/components/brand/Logo.jsx**: The React component for the logo (needs verification/update).
-   **/app/frontend/src/utils/currency.js**: Utility for formatting numbers into INR.
-   **/app/frontend/src/context/WishlistContext.js**: State management for the new wishlist feature.
-   **/app/frontend/src/pages/AuthPage.jsx**: Contains the new phone number registration/login logic.
-   **/app/frontend/public/favicon.svg**: The new, improved favicon SVG code.
-   **/app/README.md**: Project setup and run instructions.

**Areas that need refactoring**:
-   The API fetching logic in  could be extracted into a reusable custom hook (e.g., ) to improve code organization, but it is currently functional.

**key api endpoints**
-   
-   
-   
-   
-   _Note: The frontend is configured to call these endpoints at ._

**Critical Info for New Agent**
-   Your immediate task is to finalize and test a large batch of 6 new features. The code has been written but is completely unverified.
-   **Start by fixing the logo**: The agent created new SVG files for the logo but likely forgot to update the  React component. Verify this and update the component with the new SVG code from .
-   **Test everything**: After fixing the logo, run yarn run v1.22.22
info Visit https://yarnpkg.com/en/docs/cli/run for documentation about this command., then use the frontend testing agent to meticulously check all 6 new features:
    1.  **INR Currency (₹)** on all pages.
    2.  **Wishlist**: Add/remove items, view the wishlist page.
    3.  **Out-of-Stock**: Find a product with  in  and ensure its Add to Cart button is disabled.
    4.  **Phone Auth**: Test registration with a phone number and login with it.
    5.  **Reorder**: Go to the orders page and test the Reorder button.
    6.  **Notifications**: Add an item to the cart and verify the toaster notification has a close 'x' button.
-   The application is designed to work offline. All API calls will fail (which is expected) and fall back to using mock data from .

**Last 10 User Messages and any pending HUMAN messages**
1.  **User:** Requested 6 new features (INR currency, phone auth, wishlist, etc.). *(Status: IN PROGRESS)*
2.  **Agent:** Acknowledged request.
3.  **User:** Asked for setup instructions in a root . *(Status: COMPLETED)*
4.  **Agent:** Created the  file.
5.  **User:** Provided Angular code as a reference for backend API integration. *(Status: COMPLETED)*
6.  **Agent:** Implemented the API service layer.
7.  **User:** Requested a cool logo and favicon. *(Status: COMPLETED, but improvement requested)*
8.  **Agent:** Created and integrated the first version of the logo.
9.  **User:** Requested a scalable categories modal instead of a separate page. *(Status: COMPLETED)*
10. **Agent:** Implemented the categories modal.

**Project Health Check:**
-   **Broken:** Potentially. A large number of files were modified to implement new features, but no build or testing was performed. The state is unknown until tested.
-   **Mocked:** The entire backend is mocked. The application gracefully falls back to mock data when API calls fail, which they will in the current environment. All user-specific data (cart, wishlist, auth) is stored on the client-side and is not persistent.

**3rd Party Integrations**
-   None requiring API keys.

**Testing status**
-   **Testing agent used after significant changes:** NO (not after the last major batch of changes).
-   **Troubleshoot agent used after agent stuck in loop:** N/A
-   **Test files created:** None.
-   **Known regressions:** None are known, but the risk of regression is high due to the recent unverified changes.

**Credentials to test flow:**
N/A - Authentication is mocked. Any credentials will work for testing the UI flow.

**What agent forgot to execute**
-   The agent did not update the  component to use the new, improved SVG design it created.
-   The agent did not perform a build or any testing after implementing the last batch of 6 feature requests.</analysis>
